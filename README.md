# Sails-React-Boilerplate

Use React as a Template Engine in Sails.js

The app uses express-react-views

This is an Express view engine which renders React components on server. It renders static markup and does not support mounting those views on the client.

This is intended to be used as a replacement for existing server-side view solutions, like jade, ejs, or handlebars.
Iâ€™ve always loved componentization, and React allows you to componentize like a pro.

The boilerplate is a simple application that retrieves Chuck Norris quotes from a NodeJS backend with SailsJs

Install app and run 'sails lift' to start the server.
